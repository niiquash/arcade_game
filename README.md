# Overview

This is a simple arcade platformer game.

This game takes user keyboard input up, down, left, right, to control the player and navigate the map.
The map was built using Tiled maps editor.

I wrote this software to strengthen my knowledge in Python OOP. I also love working with graphics, and I love games in general.

Here's a link to the video demo.
